# Run the DAPP locally

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

# Demo app online

[Demo](https://inery-testnet-faucet-tasks-7wwbchk6r-thanhtamdc.vercel.app/)

## Clone repository and change directory to thanhtamdc then install dependency

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thanhtamdc/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks
cd thanhtamdc/
git checkout task5
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Change config
```
nano src/lib/config.ts
```

## Developing

Once you've change a directory and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```
